It’s always better to know fewer words and pronounce them well than to know a lot of words and pronounce them badly. Bad pronunciation can lead to misunderstandings that may cause mishaps.
The Language Improving Mini Project is aimed at providing a solution to the problem of poor language proficiency. The project focuses on helping individuals improve their language skills by providing them with personalized feedback and suggestions. 
The application helps for improving the pronunciation skills of the users. The ways that we took for the improving the users are courses, tutorials, inflection test and games.
The first way is course to order to improve the inflection the users need to know how the pronounce the word. So here we are provided a functionality which will convert the word given by the user into audio which helps the user know how the words are pronounced.
Next way is tutorials which helps them to improve their skills in period of time. To know progress in the user skills we are providing the inflection which are of three levels low ,medium, high. The level is  defined by the text which is displayed on the screen.

By  testing their pronunciation skills which helps them to know the user about their skills
Here to improve one should know the how the word sounds. So, here we  build an application for knowing the how the words sounds.
Along with tests , we should also know some techniques for pronunciation. For this we provided some YouTube tutorials which helps to improve their skills.
